For every function you write, you have to tell the typechecker whether you expect it to be differentially private by annotating the function head using function foo(x) :: Priv(). If you don't annotate, the typechecker will assume that the function is not DP, which might worsen the inferred bounds if it's not true.\nFor differentially private functions, you can tell the typechecker which of its arguments are actually interesting. For example, when training a model to some data with some learning rate, you are interested in the privacy of the input data, not the input model. You would then write your function signature like this: function train(data, model::Static(), eta::Static(Real)). This allows the typecheker to infer tighter bounds by setting the privacy of non-interesting arguments to infinity in certain tradeoff situations.\nIf you write a function that takes a function as an argument, you have to decide whether you want that argument to be a privacy function or not, so we can do inference properly. You have to annotate the argument by :: PrivacyFunction if you want it to be a privacy function. If you don't, we assume it is not, and the typechecker will not permit putting a privacy function into that argument.\nIf you want to use a function that contains unsupported julia syntax, like using qualified names from imported modules, you can make them a black box by annotating the function head using function foo(x) :: BlackBox(). You can only define a black box on the toplevel scope of what you want to typecheck (not inside a function, e.g.). Also, black boxes cannot have multiple methods. The typechecker will ignore a black box' function body and assign infinite sensitivity to all arguments. Warning: We cannot control what you do inside a black box, but the one thing that you really should not do is mutate the arguments. If you do that, the typechecking result will be invalid even though the typechecking code terminates without complaints.","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started/quick_guide/#Usage-examples","page":"Quick Guide","title":"Usage examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"getting_started/quick_guide/","page":"Quick Guide","title":"Quick Guide","text":"To infer the sensitivity of a simple function, use typecheck_hs_from_string:","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started/quick_guide/","page":"Quick Guide","title":"Quick Guide","text":"\njulia> typecheck_hs_from_string(\"function foo(x::Matrix{Real}, y::Matrix{Real})\n                                    2*x - y\n                                 end\")","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started/quick_guide/","page":"Quick Guide","title":"Quick Guide","text":"The result will be printed in the REPL:","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started/quick_guide/","page":"Quick Guide","title":"Quick Guide","text":"---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nType:\nFun([([NoFun(Matrix<n: Ï„_10, c: Ï„_8>[s_5 Ã— s_4](Num(Ï„_44[--]))) @ 2.0,NoFun(Matrix<n: Ï„_10, c: Ï„_11>[s_5 Ã— s_4](Num(Ï„_38[--]))) @ 1] -> NoFun(Matrix<n: Ï„_10, c: U>[s_5 Ã— s_4](Num(Ï„_40[--])))) @ Just [Matrix{Real},Matrix{Real}]])\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConstraints:\n   - top:\nconstr_25 : [final,worst,global,exact,special] IsSupremum (Ï„_44,Ï„_38) :=: Ï„_40\n   - others:\n[]\n()","category":"page"},{"location":"getting_started/quick_guide/","page":"Quick Guide","title":"Quick Guide","text":"It says the checked code is a function (Fun(...)) of two arguments which is 2-sensitive in its first and 1-sensitive in its second input (indeicated by the @ 2.0 annotation).
