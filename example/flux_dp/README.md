# Learning MNIST, differentially private

This code trains a neural network to recognize handwritten numbers using a verified differentially private implementation of stochastic gradient descent. For a detailed discussion of what's going on, visit [the tutorial](https://diffmu.github.io/DiffPrivacyInference.jl/dev/tutorial/03_flux_dp/). Run the code in the `mnist.jl` file to train your network!
